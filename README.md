# 🧱 Data Structures - Stack in C++

## 📚 Description

This project implements the **Stack** data structure in C++, using fundamental programming concepts such as pointers, classes, and encapsulation. The stack follows the **LIFO (Last In, First Out)** principle, where the last element inserted is the first one to be removed.

## 🚀 Features

- `push(int x)` – Insert an element at the top of the stack
- `pop()` – Remove the top element
- `peek()` – View the top element without removing it
- `isEmpty()` – Check if the stack is empty
- `isFull()` – Check if the stack is full
- `printStack()` – Print all elements in the stack

## 🛠️ Technologies

- Language: C++
- Paradigm: Object-Oriented Programming

## ✅ Requirements
C++ compiler (g++, clang++, MSVC)
